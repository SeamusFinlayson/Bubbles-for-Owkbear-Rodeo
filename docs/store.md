# Stat Bubbles

Add bars and bubbles to track TTRPG stats.

## How to use

### Basic

**This extension does math for you!** 

To add 12 to your stat type +12 and press Enter. To subtract 12 from your stat type -12 and press Enter. This works for every bubble.

**Deigned to be keyboard friendly.**

1. Click on a token and use the shortcut Shift + A to see and edit a token's stats.
2. Press Tab to cycle through the bubbles.
3. Press the Space key to toggle the switch.
4. When you're done press Escape and the menu will close.

Works with tokens on the **Prop**, **Mount**, and **Character** layers.

**Stat bars are created automatically** if a number greater than 0 is in the max stat (second of the color) bubble.

### For GMs

Use the **hide switch** to hide enemy stats from your players. 

The hide switch:

* Hides stat bars from players.
* Removes the context menu icon for the players.
* Turns stat bar backgrounds black to indicate that they are hidden.
